                I am a hard worker that is always excited to learn new things. From sports to musical instruments and hiking to web development, I have many interests and talents that keep me on my toes and ready for the next new thing. I enjoy working in a group setting, and am comfortable with both giving and receiving direction. However, I also function well on my own and have driven myself to learn - and subsequently accomplish - great feats I never would have thought possible at the start of the project. This drive and zeal is what has led me to be the developer that I am now, despite my relatively short time in the field, and I'm excited to see where it takes me from here.
